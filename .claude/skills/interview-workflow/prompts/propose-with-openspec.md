# propose-with-openspec

You are executing the Lincoln workflow step `propose`: generate an OpenSpec change proposal directly using the OpenSpec CLI.

## Goal

Invoke `openspec propose` using the confirmed TDD development plan to create the standard OpenSpec artifact directory under `openspec/changes/<change-name>/`.

## Input

- `session_id`: the interview session identifier
- `design_id`: the product design identifier
- `change_name`: a short kebab-case change name (e.g., `add-csv-export`)

## Steps

1. Read `requirements/<session_id>/requirements.md`.
2. Read `designs/<design_id>/tdd-plan.md`, `design-review.md`, `feature-catalog.md`, `data-model.md`, `flows.md`, `feasibility.md`, `fields.md`, and `ui-spec.md`.
3. Verify `designs/<design_id>/tdd-plan.md` contains `<!-- status: ready-for-openspec -->`.
4. Ensure `openspec/changes/<change_name>/` does not already exist, or ask the user if they want to overwrite.
5. Call the OpenSpec CLI. Try the following forms in order:
   - `openspec propose <change_name> --from designs/<design_id>/tdd-plan.md`
   - `openspec propose <change_name>` and pipe the TDD plan plus design summary into stdin
   - If neither works, read the OpenSpec CLI help (`openspec propose --help`) and adapt.
6. Verify the generated artifacts:
   - `openspec/changes/<change_name>/proposal.md`
   - `openspec/changes/<change_name>/specs/` (at least one file)
   - `openspec/changes/<change_name>/design.md`
   - `openspec/changes/<change_name>/tasks.md`
7. Ensure the OpenSpec artifact references:
   - `designs/<design_id>/tdd-plan.md`
   - `designs/<design_id>/prototype.pen`
   - Core design docs under `designs/<design_id>/`
8. If any artifact is missing, empty, or missing design references, report the error and pause for human intervention.

## Output Artifacts

- `openspec/changes/<change_name>/proposal.md`
- `openspec/changes/<change_name>/specs/*.md`
- `openspec/changes/<change_name>/design.md`
- `openspec/changes/<change_name>/tasks.md`

## Rules

- Do not bypass the OpenSpec CLI by manually writing the artifact files.
- Preserve the OpenSpec structure exactly as the CLI generates it.
- OpenSpec tasks must be driven by `designs/<design_id>/tdd-plan.md`.
- After success, tell the user to run: `claude split-to-github <session_id> <change_name>`.
